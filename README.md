# Daunting-Devitos

## Syponsis
DeVito Lounge is a full-stack web application that brings the classic blackjack game to the web, featuring secure user accounts, real-time gameplay, and persistent data management. Players can join or create game rooms, place bets, and compete against a dealer, with future scalability to support multiplayer sessions. The system’s backend is powered by a RESTful Web API that handles user authentication, game state management, and balance tracking, while the frontend provides an intuitive interface for smooth and interactive gameplay. Built with scalability and modularity in mind, the project’s architecture allows easy expansion for additional features like leaderboards, chat, and multiplayer functionality.
